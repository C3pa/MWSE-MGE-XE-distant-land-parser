# Documentation

Looking for documentation? Please [click here]().

## Building

Documentation can also be built locally for testing or personal use. To do this you will need a copy of [Python](https://www.python.org/).

Run `.\install.bat` to install the required dependencies, then run `.\serve.bat` to build and serve the documentation locally.

Alternatively build tasks for both are available in vscode.
